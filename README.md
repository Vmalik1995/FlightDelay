# Flight Delay Prediction using Machine Learning.
The Project is made using machine learning algorithms and trains the model to predict and validate the model which predicts the flight delays.

# Outline of the Project

* Cleaning and Analyzing Flight Data Set containing 50mil rows and 31 columns.
* Training , imputing the model to obtain the rmse of 80.04 on the set.
* Using HyperParameter tuning to fine tune the prediction made by the model, especially the Random Forest Regressor.

# Steps Followed-

* Download the dataset using the Opendatasets library of kaggle.com
* Cleanng and analyzing the data , finding insights like airlines delays, airline to travel with.
* Hawaiian airline is the best one in order to travel with as it has shortest delays.
